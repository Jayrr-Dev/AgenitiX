# Install Convex AI Agent Package

To complete the AI Agent node setup, you need to install the @convex-dev/agent package:

```bash
pnpm add @convex-dev/agent
```

After installation, you'll need to:

1. Create `convex/convex.config.ts` with the agent component
2. Add AI agent server actions to handle processing
3. Update the schema if needed for agent threads and messages

This will be done in the next steps of the implementation.
