# Handle Position Editor Feature

## Overview

The Handle Position Editor is a new feature that allows users to dynamically change the positions of individual node handles through the Node Inspector interface. This provides complete flexibility in node layout design while maintaining connection compatibility and type safety.

**✅ ISSUE RESOLVED**: Fixed the issue where handles were only moving visually but actual connection points weren't updating. The solution involved forcing ReactFlow to completely re-render nodes when handle positions change by creating new node instances in the store.

## Features

### ✅ Interactive Position Controls

- **Dropdown Selectors**: Each handle gets its own position selector with visual icons
- **Real-time Updates**: Position changes are applied immediately to the node
- **Type Safety**: Maintains all existing handle type validation and connection rules

### ✅ Persistent Configuration

- **Data Schema Integration**: Handle overrides are stored in the node's `handleOverrides` field
- **Automatic Persistence**: Changes are saved automatically with the node data
- **Default Fallback**: Handles fall back to their original NodeSpec positions when overrides are removed

### ✅ Modern UI/UX Design

- **Grouped by Type**: Input and output handles are clearly separated and labeled
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded handles (blue for inputs, green for output)
- **Override Status**: Clear indication when handles are using custom positions
- **Reset Functionality**: One-click reset to restore all handles to default positions

### ✅ System Integration

- **Node Inspector Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into the existing Handles section
- **ReactFlow Compatibility**: Fully compatible with existing React Flow positioning system
- **Handle Spacing**: Smart spacing calculation for multiple handles on the same side
- **Connection Preservation**: Existing connections are maintained during position changes

## Implementation Details

### Components Created

1. **HandlePositionEditor.tsx** - Main interactive component with dropdown controls
2. **BaseNodeData Interface** - Extended with `handleOverrides` field
3. **withNodeScaffold Updates** - Dynamic handle positioning logic
4. **NodeInspector Integration** - UI integration in the Handles section

### Data Structure

```typescript
interface HandleOverride {
  handleId: string;
  position: "top" | "bottom" | "left" | "right";
}

// Added to BaseNodeData
handleOverrides?: Array<HandleOverride>;
```

### User Experience

1. **Access**: Open any node in the Node Inspector → Handles section
2. **Edit**: Use dropdown selectors to change individual handle positions
3. **Reset**: Click "Reset All" to restore default positions
4. **Feedback**: Toast notifications confirm all changes

### Technical Features

- **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support with proper type definitions
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses React.useMemo for efficient re-rendering
- **Accessible**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Theme Consistent**: Uses shadcn/ui components for design system compliance

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced Node Design**: Users can create custom node layouts optimized for their workflows
2. **Better Visual Organization**: Handles can be positioned to reduce connection crossing
3. **Improved Usability**: More intuitive node layouts for complex flow diagrams
4. **Maintained Compatibility**: All existing nodes and connections continue to work unchanged

## Future Enhancements

- **Drag & Drop Positioning**: Direct handle manipulation on the node canvas
- **Position Templates**: Preset handle arrangements for common patterns
- **Visual Guidelines**: Alignment helpers and position suggestions
- **Bulk Operations**: Multi-handle selection and positioning tools
