# Email Reader Requirements

## Introduction

The email reader system provides inbox parsing and message retrieval capabilities for AgenitiX workflows. This system enables users to read emails from configured accounts, filter messages, extract content, and trigger workflows based on incoming emails.

## Requirements

3. WHEN account is Outlook THEN system SHALL use Microsoft Graph API for message retrieval
4. WHEN account is IMAP THEN system SHALL use IMAP protocol for message access
5. WHEN connection established THEN system SHALL display inbox connection status
6. IF connection fails THEN system SHALL show error message with retry option
7. WHEN account credentials expire THEN system SHALL prompt for re-authentication

### Requirement 2: Message Filtering and Search

4. WHEN filter by date THEN system SHALL support date ranges and relative dates (last 24h, week, etc.)
5. WHEN filter by content THEN system SHALL search message body and attachments
6. WHEN multiple filters applied THEN system SHALL support AND/OR logic combinations
7. WHEN filter by read status THEN system SHALL distinguish between read and unread messages
8. IF no messages match filters THEN system SHALL return empty result set

### Requirement 3: Message Content Extraction

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want to extract specific content from emails, so that I can use email data in my workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN message is retrieved THEN system SHALL extract sender, recipient, subject, and timestamp
2. WHEN message has HTML content THEN system SHALL provide both HTML and plain text versions
3. WHEN message has attachments THEN system SHALL list attachment names, sizes, and types
4. WHEN extracting attachments THEN system SHALL support download and content access
5. WHEN message is part of thread THEN system SHALL provide thread context and relationships
6. WHEN message has headers THEN system SHALL extract relevant email headers
7. WHEN message has embedded images THEN system SHALL handle inline content appropriately
8. IF message is encrypted THEN system SHALL indicate encryption status

### Requirement 4: Real-time Email Monitoring

**User Story:** As an automation user, I want to monitor my inbox in real-time, so that workflows can trigger immediately when new emails arrive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN real-time monitoring enabled THEN system SHALL check for new messages periodically
2. WHEN new message arrives THEN system SHALL trigger connected workflow nodes immediately
3. WHEN monitoring frequency configured THEN system SHALL respect user-defined intervals
4. WHEN multiple readers monitor same inbox THEN system SHALL coordinate to avoid conflicts
5. WHEN system is offline THEN system SHALL catch up on missed messages when reconnected
6. WHEN rate limits approached THEN system SHALL adjust monitoring frequency automatically
7. IF monitoring fails THEN system SHALL log errors and attempt reconnection

### Requirement 5: Message State Management

**User Story:** As a workflow user, I want to track which emails have been processed, so that I don't process the same email multiple times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN message is read THEN system SHALL mark message as processed in local state
2. WHEN workflow processes message THEN system SHALL update processing status
3. WHEN user wants to reprocess THEN system SHALL allow manual reset of processed status
4. WHEN message is deleted from inbox THEN system SHALL handle gracefully
5. WHEN multiple workflows process same message THEN system SHALL track per-workflow status
6. WHEN system restarts THEN system SHALL restore previous processing state
7. IF state corruption occurs THEN system SHALL provide recovery options

### Requirement 6: Batch Processing and Pagination

**User Story:** As a user with large inboxes, I want to process emails in batches, so that the system remains responsive and doesn't overwhelm resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN inbox has many messages THEN system SHALL process in configurable batch sizes
2. WHEN batch processing THEN system SHALL provide progress indicators
3. WHEN user configures page size THEN system SHALL respect pagination limits
4. WHEN processing large batches THEN system SHALL allow pause and resume operations
5. WHEN memory usage high THEN system SHALL optimize message loading and caching
6. WHEN API rate limits hit THEN system SHALL implement exponential backoff
7. IF batch processing fails THEN system SHALL resume from last successful batch

### Requirement 7: Output Data Structure

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want consistent email data output, so that I can reliably connect to other nodes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN message is processed THEN system SHALL output standardized JSON structure
2. WHEN outputting message data THEN system SHALL include all extracted fields consistently
3. WHEN message has attachments THEN system SHALL provide attachment metadata in output
4. WHEN multiple messages processed THEN system SHALL output array of message objects
5. WHEN no messages found THEN system SHALL output empty array or null appropriately
6. WHEN error occurs THEN system SHALL output error information in consistent format
7. IF data transformation needed THEN system SHALL provide configurable output mapping

### Requirement 8: Integration with Email Account Node

**User Story:** As a workflow creator, I want emailReader to use configured email accounts, so that I don't need to reconfigure credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN emailReader node added THEN system SHALL detect available configured email accounts
2. WHEN account selected THEN system SHALL use existing authentication credentials
3. WHEN account connection changes THEN emailReader SHALL update connection status
4. WHEN multiple accounts available THEN system SHALL provide account selection dropdown
5. WHEN no accounts configured THEN system SHALL prompt user to configure email account first
6. WHEN account permissions insufficient THEN system SHALL display specific permission requirements
7. IF account becomes unavailable THEN system SHALL gracefully handle disconnection

### Requirement 9: Performance and Efficiency

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want email reading to be efficient, so that it doesn't impact overall system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading messages THEN system SHALL implement efficient caching strategies
2. WHEN same message accessed multiple times THEN system SHALL serve from cache
3. WHEN inbox has thousands of messages THEN system SHALL use incremental loading
4. WHEN network is slow THEN system SHALL optimize API calls and data transfer
5. WHEN processing attachments THEN system SHALL implement lazy loading
6. WHEN memory usage grows THEN system SHALL implement garbage collection
7. IF performance degrades THEN system SHALL provide diagnostic information

### Requirement 10: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a workflow user, I want robust error handling, so that temporary issues don't break my email workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connection fails THEN system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
2. WHEN API rate limits exceeded THEN system SHALL wait and retry automatically
3. WHEN authentication expires THEN system SHALL attempt token refresh
4. WHEN message format is invalid THEN system SHALL log error and continue processing
5. WHEN inbox access denied THEN system SHALL provide clear error message
6. WHEN system resources low THEN system SHALL gracefully reduce processing load
7. IF critical error occurs THEN system SHALL maintain system stability and log details
