## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Rate Limits**: Implement robust rate limiting and backoff strategies
- **Large Message Volumes**: Use pagination and streaming for memory efficiency
- **Provider API Changes**: Create abstraction layer for easy adaptation
- **Authentication Complexity**: Leverage existing emailAccount infrastructure

### Integration Risks
- **emailAccount Dependency**: Ensure backward compatibility and graceful degradation
- **Node Communication**: Thoroughly test data flow between nodes
- **UI Consistency**: Follow established patterns from other email nodes
- **Performance Impact**: Monitor and optimize resource usage throughout development
