# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The StoreLocal node enhancement transforms the current placeholder implementation into a fully functional localStorage management system. This node will provide a visual interface for storing and deleting data in the browser's localStorage, with support for complex objects, type-safe operations, and visual feedback for user interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want to store complex data objects in localStorage through a visual node interface, so that I can persist data across browser sessions and share it between different parts of my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the node receives an object input THEN it SHALL parse and store each key-value pair as separate localStorage entries
2. WHEN the object contains nested objects THEN it SHALL serialize them as JSON strings before storage
3. WHEN the object contains primitive values THEN it SHALL store them as properly typed string representations
4. WHEN the storage operation completes successfully THEN it SHALL output a success status through the boolean output handle
5. IF the input object is invalid or empty THEN it SHALL not perform any storage operations and output false

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want to control when storage operations occur through a boolean trigger input, so that I can precisely time when data is persisted to localStorage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the boolean input transitions from false to true (pulse) THEN it SHALL trigger the storage/deletion operation
2. WHEN the boolean input remains true without transition THEN it SHALL not trigger repeated operations
3. WHEN the boolean input is false THEN it SHALL not perform any storage operations regardless of data input
4. WHEN no boolean input is connected THEN it SHALL default to inactive state
5. WHEN the pulse is detected AND the node is in store mode THEN it SHALL store the input data
6. WHEN the pulse is detected AND the node is in delete mode THEN it SHALL delete matching keys from localStorage

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want to toggle between Store and Delete modes through a visual button interface, so that I can control whether the node stores or removes data from localStorage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the mode toggle button is clicked THEN it SHALL switch between "Store" and "Delete" modes
2. WHEN in Store mode THEN the button SHALL display "Store" text and appropriate styling
3. WHEN in Delete mode THEN the button SHALL display "Delete" text and appropriate styling
4. WHEN the mode changes THEN it SHALL persist the mode setting in the node's data
5. WHEN the node is in Store mode AND triggered THEN it SHALL store the input data to localStorage
6. WHEN the node is in Delete mode AND triggered THEN it SHALL delete keys matching the input object keys from localStorage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want the node to provide visual feedback about its current state and recent operations, so that I can understand what actions have been performed and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the node is enabled and ready THEN it SHALL display normal styling
2. WHEN the node is disabled THEN it SHALL display dimmed/disabled styling
3. WHEN a storage operation is in progress THEN it SHALL display loading/processing visual feedback
4. WHEN a storage operation succeeds THEN it SHALL briefly display success feedback
5. WHEN a storage operation fails THEN it SHALL display error feedback with appropriate messaging
6. WHEN the node is expanded THEN it SHALL show detailed status information and operation history

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want the node to handle complex data types safely and provide type-safe operations, so that I can store various data formats without corruption or type errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing string values THEN it SHALL preserve them as quoted JSON strings
2. WHEN storing number values THEN it SHALL preserve them as string representations of numbers
3. WHEN storing boolean values THEN it SHALL preserve them as string representations ("true"/"false")
4. WHEN storing object values THEN it SHALL serialize them as JSON strings
5. WHEN storing array values THEN it SHALL serialize them as JSON strings
6. WHEN retrieving stored values THEN it SHALL maintain type information for proper deserialization
7. IF JSON serialization fails THEN it SHALL handle the error gracefully and report the failure

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want the node to provide comprehensive error handling and validation, so that invalid operations don't crash my workflow and I receive clear feedback about issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the input data is null or undefined THEN it SHALL not perform any operations and output false
2. WHEN localStorage is not available (e.g., private browsing) THEN it SHALL handle the error gracefully and report the limitation
3. WHEN localStorage quota is exceeded THEN it SHALL catch the error and provide appropriate feedback
4. WHEN invalid JSON is encountered during serialization THEN it SHALL handle the error and report the specific issue
5. WHEN a storage operation fails for any reason THEN it SHALL log the error and output false through the status handle
6. WHEN in Delete mode and a key doesn't exist THEN it SHALL handle this gracefully without throwing errors

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want the node to integrate seamlessly with the existing node architecture and follow established patterns, so that it behaves consistently with other nodes in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the node is created THEN it SHALL use the established NodeSpec pattern with proper typing
2. WHEN the node data changes THEN it SHALL use the useNodeData hook for state management
3. WHEN the node is expanded/collapsed THEN it SHALL respect the size configuration system
4. WHEN the node handles are connected THEN it SHALL use the established handle system with proper type codes
5. WHEN the node is disabled THEN it SHALL follow the standard disabled state patterns
6. WHEN the node validates data THEN it SHALL use Zod schemas for type safety
7. WHEN the node reports errors THEN it SHALL use the established validation and error reporting systems
