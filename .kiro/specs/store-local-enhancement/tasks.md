- [ ] 7. Integrate pulse detection with operation execution
  - Connect pulse detection logic to the main node component
  - Implement operation triggering based on mode (store/delete) and pulse detection
  - Add proper state management for trigger state tracking

  - Ensure operations only execute when both pulse is detected and node is enabled
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.5, 2.6, 6.1_

- [ ] 8. Implement store mode functionality
  - Add logic to process input data and call localStorage store operations
  - Implement proper data validation before storage operations

  - Add success/failure status updates and output propagation
  - Include comprehensive error handling for storage failures
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.5, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 6.1, 6.4, 6.5_

- [ ] 9. Implement delete mode functionality
  - Add logic to extract keys from input data and call localStorage delete operations

  - Implement key-based deletion ignoring values as specified
  - Add proper handling for non-existent keys without throwing errors
  - Include status updates and output propagation for delete operations
  - _Requirements: 2.6, 3.5, 6.6_

- [x] 10. Update node handles and data flow

  - Modify handle configuration to include data input (JSON) and trigger input (Boolean)
  - Update output handle to provide boolean status of last operation
  - Implement proper data flow from input handles to internal state
  - Add handle connection detection and auto-disable functionality
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 2.4, 7.4, 7.5_


- [ ] 11. Enhance visual rendering and UI states
  - Update collapsed and expanded view rendering with new components
  - Implement proper disabled state styling and behavior

  - Integrate all new components into the main node rendering logic
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 7.3, 7.5_


- [ ] 12. Add comprehensive error handling and validation
  - Implement input data validation with proper error reporting
  - Add localStorage availability checks with graceful degradation
  - Include quota exceeded handling with user-friendly messages
  - Add JSON serialization error handling with specific error details
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 7.7_
