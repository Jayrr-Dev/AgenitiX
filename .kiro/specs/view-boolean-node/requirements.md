# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The viewBoolean node is a simple visualization node that takes a boolean input value, displays it in a user-friendly format, and passes the boolean value through as output. This node serves as both a visual indicator and a pass-through component in workflows where boolean state needs to be monitored or debugged.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want to visualize boolean values in my flow, so that I can monitor true/false states and debug my workflow logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a boolean value is connected to the input THEN the node SHALL display the boolean state visually
2. WHEN the input is true THEN the node SHALL show a clear "true" indicator with appropriate styling
3. WHEN the input is false THEN the node SHALL show a clear "false" indicator with appropriate styling
4. WHEN no input is connected THEN the node SHALL show a default/disconnected state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want the boolean value to pass through the node unchanged, so that I can use it for further processing while still monitoring its state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a boolean input is received THEN the node SHALL output the exact same boolean value
2. WHEN the input changes THEN the output SHALL update immediately to match
3. WHEN no input is connected THEN the output SHALL be undefined or null

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want the node to be compact and efficient, so that it doesn't take up unnecessary space in my workflow canvas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the node is collapsed THEN it SHALL use minimal space while still showing the boolean state
2. WHEN the node is expanded THEN it SHALL provide a clear, readable display of the boolean value
3. WHEN the boolean state changes THEN the visual update SHALL be immediate and smooth

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want the node to handle edge cases gracefully, so that my workflow remains stable even with unexpected inputs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a non-boolean value is received THEN the node SHALL handle it gracefully without crashing
2. WHEN the input is undefined or null THEN the node SHALL display an appropriate "no value" state
3. WHEN the input connection is removed THEN the node SHALL reset to its default state
