# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The createObject node is a visual workflow component that allows users to create and output JSON objects through an intuitive interface. Similar to the createText node but specifically designed for structured data creation, it features fixed curly braces `{}` as a visual indicator and provides a clean way to construct JSON objects within the flow editor.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want to create JSON objects visually so that I can structure data for downstream nodes

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the node is collapsed THEN it SHALL display fixed curly braces `{}` as the visual indicator
2. WHEN the node is expanded THEN it SHALL provide a textarea for JSON object input
3. WHEN valid JSON is entered THEN the node SHALL output the parsed object through the output handle
4. WHEN invalid JSON is entered THEN the node SHALL show validation feedback and not propagate invalid data
5. WHEN the node receives input from connected nodes THEN it SHALL merge or use that input in object construction

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want the createObject node to integrate seamlessly with the existing node system so that it follows established patterns and behaviors

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the node is created THEN it SHALL follow the NodeSpec architecture with proper typing
2. WHEN the node is disabled THEN it SHALL not propagate outputs and show disabled state
3. WHEN the node has no valid content THEN it SHALL set isActive to false
4. WHEN the node has valid JSON content THEN it SHALL set isActive to true and propagate the object
5. WHEN the node is resized THEN it SHALL respect the dynamic sizing system (collapsed/expanded sizes)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want proper handle configuration so that I can connect the createObject node to other nodes in my workflow

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the node is rendered THEN it SHALL have a JSON input handle on the top for receiving data
2. WHEN the node is rendered THEN it SHALL have a JSON output handle on the right for sending objects
3. WHEN the node is rendered THEN it SHALL have a boolean input handle on the left for trigger/enable control
4. WHEN input is received through handles THEN it SHALL properly merge or utilize that data in object creation
5. WHEN the node outputs data THEN it SHALL use the correct JSON data type for type-safe connections

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want visual feedback and validation so that I can easily identify the node's state and fix any issues

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the node contains valid JSON THEN it SHALL show active state styling
2. WHEN the node contains invalid JSON THEN it SHALL show error state and validation messages
3. WHEN the node is disabled THEN it SHALL show disabled state styling with reduced opacity
4. WHEN the node is collapsed THEN it SHALL show the `{}` icon clearly centered
5. WHEN the node is expanded THEN it SHALL show the full JSON editing interface

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want the createObject node to handle default states and initialization properly so that it works predictably from the moment it's added

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the node is first created THEN it SHALL initialize with an empty object `{}`
2. WHEN the node has no user input THEN it SHALL default to the empty object state
3. WHEN the node is reset or cleared THEN it SHALL return to the default empty object state
4. WHEN the node receives external input THEN it SHALL properly merge with or replace the default state
5. WHEN the node is saved and reloaded THEN it SHALL maintain its configured object state
