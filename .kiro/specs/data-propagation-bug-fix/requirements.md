# Requirements Document - Data Propagation Bug Fix

## Introduction

This specification addresses a critical bug in the AgenitiX flow editor where node state propagation becomes inconsistent in production environments. The issue manifests as visual state changes not being reflected in the internal node state, causing workflow execution to behave incorrectly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: State Synchronization

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want node state changes to be immediately and consistently reflected across all connected nodes, so that my workflows execute predictably in both development and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user toggles a trigger node THEN the internal state SHALL update immediately
2. WHEN the internal state updates THEN all connected nodes SHALL receive the new value within 100ms
3. WHEN the application is running in production THEN state propagation SHALL behave identically to development
4. WHEN a node state changes THEN the visual representation SHALL always match the internal state
5. WHEN multiple rapid state changes occur THEN the system SHALL handle them without race conditions

### Requirement 2: Production Environment Stability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to perform consistently in production builds, so that users don't experience different behavior between environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built for production THEN state management SHALL not introduce hydration mismatches
2. WHEN Zustand store rehydrates from localStorage THEN all node states SHALL be correctly restored
3. WHEN Next.js performs server-side rendering THEN client-side state SHALL sync properly on hydration
4. WHEN JSON serialization occurs for state comparison THEN it SHALL handle all data types without errors
5. WHEN state persistence is enabled THEN it SHALL not cause state desynchronization

### Requirement 3: Debug and Monitoring Capabilities

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive debugging tools for production state issues, so that I can quickly identify and resolve state synchronization problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN state synchronization issues occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed debug information
2. WHEN running in production THEN debug hooks SHALL provide real-time state monitoring
3. WHEN state gets "stuck" THEN the system SHALL detect and alert about the condition
4. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN performance impact SHALL be minimal
5. WHEN state comparison fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 4: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a workflow designer with existing flows, I want my current workflows to continue working after the bug fix, so that I don't lose any existing automation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the fix is applied THEN existing node configurations SHALL remain functional
2. WHEN legacy state data exists THEN it SHALL be migrated seamlessly
3. WHEN the system updates THEN no workflow data SHALL be lost
4. WHEN nodes are upgraded THEN their behavior SHALL remain consistent
5. WHEN the fix is deployed THEN users SHALL not need to recreate their workflows

### Requirement 5: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user working with complex workflows, I want state updates to be performant, so that my workflow editor remains responsive even with many nodes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN state comparison occurs THEN it SHALL complete within 10ms for typical node data
2. WHEN multiple nodes update simultaneously THEN the system SHALL batch updates efficiently
3. WHEN deep object comparison is needed THEN it SHALL use optimized algorithms
4. WHEN state updates are frequent THEN memory usage SHALL remain stable
5. WHEN the workflow has 100+ nodes THEN state propagation SHALL remain under 500ms
