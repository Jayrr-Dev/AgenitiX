## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Rate Limits**: Implement robust rate limiting and queuing
- **Large Attachments**: Use streaming and chunked processing
- **Provider API Changes**: Create abstraction layer for easy adaptation
- **Authentication Complexity**: Leverage existing emailAccount infrastructure

### Integration Risks
- **emailAccount Dependency**: Ensure backward compatibility and graceful degradation
- **Template System**: Create flexible template processing with fallbacks
- **Batch Processing**: Implement efficient queuing and progress tracking
- **Error Recovery**: Provide clear feedback and recovery options

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional**: All requirements implemented and tested
2. **Performance**: Handles 1,000+ emails per hour efficiently
3. **Reliability**: 99.9% delivery success rate with proper error recovery
4. **Usability**: Intuitive composition interface with clear status feedback
5. **Integration**: Seamless workflow with emailAccount and other nodes
6. **Security**: Secure message handling and credential protection
