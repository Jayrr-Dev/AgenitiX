# AI Agent Node Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Agent Node is a core component that integrates Convex AI agents into the AgenitiX visual workflow platform. This node enables users to create intelligent agents that can process text input, maintain conversation context, and generate AI-powered responses using large language models. The node serves as a bridge between user workflows and AI capabilities, providing a simple interface for complex AI interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want to create an AI agent node that can receive text input and JSON context from other nodes, so that I can integrate controlled AI processing into my automation workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds an AI agent node to the canvas THEN the system SHALL display a node with a text input handle on the left side and a JSON input handle on the top
2. WHEN text data is connected to the input handle THEN the system SHALL receive and store the input text internally as user context
3. WHEN JSON data is connected to the JSON handle THEN the system SHALL receive and use it as additional context or configuration
4. WHEN the node receives empty or invalid input text THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully and may produce appropriate error output

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want the AI agent node to process input text only when activated by other nodes, so that I can control when AI processing occurs through my workflow logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN isActive is false THEN the system SHALL not send any requests to the AI model regardless of input
2. WHEN isActive transitions from false to true AND valid input text is present THEN the system SHALL initiate a new AI processing request
3. WHEN isActive transitions from true to false during processing THEN the system SHALL cancel any ongoing AI processing
4. WHEN the node has no activation signal from other nodes THEN the system SHALL remain inactive
5. WHEN isActive is controlled externally (by other nodes) THEN the system SHALL respond immediately to activation state changes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want the AI agent node to show different processing states, so that I can understand what the node is currently doing and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the node is idle THEN the system SHALL display isProcessing as null (no active processing)
2. WHEN the node begins AI processing THEN the system SHALL set isProcessing to a pending Promise
3. WHEN AI processing completes successfully THEN the system SHALL resolve the Promise with the agent's response
4. WHEN AI processing fails THEN the system SHALL reject the Promise with an error message
5. WHEN isProcessing is pending THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator in the node UI

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want the AI agent node to output different types of results, so that downstream nodes can handle both successful responses and errors appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN isProcessing Promise is fulfilled THEN the system SHALL output the AI agent's text response to the output handle
2. WHEN isProcessing Promise is rejected THEN the system SHALL output the error message to the output handle
3. WHEN isProcessing is pending THEN the system SHALL output null to prevent downstream processing
4. WHEN the node is disabled or inactive THEN the system SHALL output null to the output handle
5. WHEN output changes THEN the system SHALL propagate the new value to connected downstream nodes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want to configure the AI agent's behavior and model settings, so that I can customize the agent for different use cases and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the node inspector THEN the system SHALL display configuration options for the AI agent
2. WHEN a user modifies agent settings THEN the system SHALL save the configuration to the node data
3. WHEN the node processes input THEN the system SHALL use the configured settings for the AI agent
4. WHEN no configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use sensible default settings
5. WHEN invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL display validation errors and prevent processing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want the AI agent node to maintain conversation context, so that I can build conversational workflows that remember previous interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the node processes its first input THEN the system SHALL create a new conversation thread
2. WHEN the node processes subsequent inputs THEN the system SHALL continue the existing conversation thread
3. WHEN the node is reset or cleared THEN the system SHALL create a new conversation thread
4. WHEN conversation context becomes too large THEN the system SHALL manage context size according to configured limits
5. WHEN thread creation or continuation fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and report it

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want the AI agent node to handle errors gracefully, so that workflow execution doesn't break when AI processing fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI model requests fail THEN the system SHALL capture the error and set isProcessing to rejected
2. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL retry the request according to configured retry settings
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL wait and retry according to rate limit policies
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL report the authentication error clearly
5. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error details for debugging while showing user-friendly messages

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a workflow designer, I want the AI agent node to be visually clear about its current state, so that I can quickly understand the node's status during workflow execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the node is enabled and ready THEN the system SHALL display the node with normal styling
2. WHEN the node is disabled or not activated THEN the system SHALL display the node with dimmed/disabled styling
3. WHEN the node is processing (isProcessing is pending) THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator or animation
4. WHEN the node has an error (isProcessing is rejected) THEN the system SHALL display error styling or indicators
5. WHEN the node is expanded THEN the system SHALL show the current processing state, input text, and AI response
