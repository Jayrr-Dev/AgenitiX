For complex errors that require human judgment, provide detailed explanations and suggested solutions\n5. Run the TypeScript compiler again to verify fixes\n6. Report a summary of what was fixed\n\nFocus on:\n- Type errors and missing type annotations\n- Import/export issues\n- Interface and type definition problems\n- Generic type issues\n- Null/undefined safety issues\n\nUse these commands:\n- `npx tsc --noEmit` to check for errors without generating files\n- `npx tsc --noEmit --pretty` for better formatted error output\n- Focus on the specific file that was saved: {{file_path}}\n\nBe thorough but efficient - fix what can be automatically fixed and clearly explain what needs manual attention.",
