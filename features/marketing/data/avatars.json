The team at Agenitix mapped out everything I hated doing and built flows to handle them. Client onboarding? Automated. Feedback loops? Done. Now I can focus on creative work without babysitting my calendar or inbox. I still don\u2019t understand how n8n works, but I don\u2019t need to. These folks made it feel easy.",
