The new nodes must have a toggle button and Icon. After Creating a new node you must REGISTER the NODE in FlowEditor.tsx , then add the NODE to the Sidebar.tsx then finally add to NodeInspector.tsx. There's a common issue with the Nodeinspector where you need to use UseEffect to SYNC the inputs to the NODES local storage.

Nodes have two state 1. ICON state and EXPANDED State
The Toggle button is {showUI ? '⦿' : '⦾'} when press expands the nodes. The default state is the ICON state. 

ICON node always have a width of 60px and height of 60px. Unless its a text based node it has a width of 120px - height of 60. 
EXPANDED nodes are 120px by 120px unless otherwise stated
